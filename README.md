# My Website

Hi there. So you came looking for the source code, did you? My personal site doesn't just **look** basic, it **is** basic. I looked through dozens of site templates for inspiration and struggled with choosing the right layouts and colors for *ages* before I finally realized - the reason I can't choose is because I didn't like any of them. All these designs just got in the way of the stuff I wanted to share.

It's not that I miss 1995 Web 1.0 (there were a lot of terrible sites back then too), but a good website should be content-first, meaning that all the important stuff is immediately accessible. My biggest gripe is a website that opens to a giant splash image and nothing else. It's just extra work to get to the stuff you came there for. That's why this site consists of a single HTML file, a logo, and LOTS of content. Yeah, there's a little CSS in there, for flavor, but it's mostly because I don't like serifed fonts. 

However, one feature we should never leave out is accessibility to assistive devices. Each element on this site is fully described with Aria attributes for screen readers.

The inspiration for this site is that all-time classic, https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/, and its sibling, http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/ .
