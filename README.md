# My Website

Hi there. So you came looking for the source code, did you? My personal site doesn't just **look** basic, it **is** basic. That's the point! It's not that I miss 1995 Web 1.0 (there were a lot of terrible sites back then too), but a good website should be content-first, meaning that all the important stuff is immediately accessible. My biggest gripe is a website that opens to a giant splash screen image and nothing else. It's just extra work to get to the stuff you came there for. That's why this site consists of a single HTML file, a logo, and LOTS of content. It's also accessible for screen readers and assistive devices using Aria labels.

The inspiration for this site is that all-time classic, https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/, and its sibling, http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/ .
